# EEG-based-Human-Motion-Intention-Classification
The objective of this project is to classify the motion intentions of the brain from 9 subjects into four classes (left hand, right hand, both feet and tongue). The architecture we tried includes convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network (GRU, LSTM) and the hybrid structure of CNN and RNN.
