# EEG-based-Human-Motion-Intention-Classification
The objective of this project is to classify the motion intentions of the brain into four classes (left hand, right hand, both feet and tongue). 

The data is collected from 9 different subjects (persons), with 22 EEG electrodes and 3 EOG electrodes.


The implemented model includes convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network (GRU, LSTM) and the hybrid structure of CNN and RNN.
